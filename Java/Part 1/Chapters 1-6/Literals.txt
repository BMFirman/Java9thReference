As a baseline literals especially with numbers are 32 bit ints by default.

Specifiying octal:
	Use a leading 0 eg 077
	Note that any number out of the range 0-7 will result in a compiler error

Specifing hex:
	Use a leading 0X/x
	Substitute 10-15 with A-F/a-f
	Keep the capitals consistent,stick with one convention

Specifying long:
	Long is 64bit by default
	Append capital L to reduce ambiguity
	The largest possible long is 9223372036854775807L

Specifying ints with binary literals:
	Staring with JDK7 use 0B/b to specify integer literals
		0b101101
	You may also split the ints with _ 123_456 like so

Specifying floating point:
	These are by default double precsion and can be represented as follows
	6.123
	6.022E/e+/-23
	Hex floating point uses P/p instead of E/e
	Embeding enderscores is also allowed

Boolean literals:
	Can only be applied to booleans:

Character literals:
	16bit unicode
	All ascii characters can be directly used
	Octal input \141, 'a'
	Hex input \u0061 'a'

String literals:
	"Are contained in double quotes"
	Unlike C/++ Strings are objects not arrays
