Casting has three variations, using integer type like ints and floating values like doubles.

For example when converting from an int to a byte and the int is larger than the byte,
perform a modulo on the int by the range of the byte.

When converting floating values and integer type the floating point is truncated,
if the truncated value is to large for the resulting type it will be subject to a modulo operation.

An example where automatic int conversion causes an error:
	byte b = 50;
	b = b * 2; // the value 100 is an int trying to be stored back into a byte

	byte b = 50;
	b = (byte) (b * 2);
